# Summary

*-- Stable --*

This setup mainly follows the one written by [btkramm](https://github.com/btkramm/dotfiles/tree/main/config/nvim), just because it's not bloated.


## LSP

Some LSPs don't work quite right: 
- Python: "ok" with Pyright
- Lua: not working "ok" enough, don't know how to fix it yet
- Ruby: kill me plx
