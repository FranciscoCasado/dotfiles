# Global Guidelines

- NEVER add docstrings
- NEVER add comments for code sections or steps
- Avoid comments as much as possible, but include them if they explain edge-cases from external systems, or instructions that human gave you explicitly
- NEVER user emojis

# Language Specific Guidelines

## Python
- Always suggest pythonic code according to the latest standards
- Prefer for loops instead of nested list or dict comprehensions, specially if there is conditional logic
